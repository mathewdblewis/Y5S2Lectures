text: Functional Analysis, by Walter Rudin

we look at normed linear spaces
we could instead look at topological linear spaces
however this is less motivated (according to Marcello)

norms and seminorms:
(V,+,*) vector space over R or C
convex combination: ax+by for some 0≤a,b≤1 st. a+b=1
a set is convex if it is closed under convex combination
an extremal point is one that is not a non trivial convex
combination of two elements

a normed vector space (V,+,*) with a norm ||:V->R st:
|v|≥0, and |v|=0 iff v=0    (strict positivity)
|av| = |a||v|               (homogeneity)
|v+w|≤|v|+|w| for v,w in V  (triangle inequality)

lemma: suppose (V,||) a normed linear space (NLS)
1:   let d(v,w) = |v-w|, the d is a metric on V
2:   ||:V->R is contractive (hence continuous)
     eg: ||v|-|w|| ≤ |v-w|

he proves this (trivial)

theorem: NLS are metric spaces
proof left as exercise


cor: addition and multiplication are continuous

addition is a function from V*V to V
scalar mult is a function from K*V to V
where V is the vector space and K the scalar space

def: equivalence of norms:
two norms in a vector space V are eq. iff TE
a,b>0 st. a|v|' ≤ |v| ≤ b||v|'
equivalently: TE c>0 st. |v|'/c ≤ |v| ≤ c|v|'


thm: this notion of equivalence is an equivalence relation
thm: equivalent norms induce the same topology
