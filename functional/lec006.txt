prop: let (V,||) be a NLS that is infinite dimensional
then B_1(0)={v:|v|≤1} is not compact
he proves this

random question: is the intersection of an arbitrary set of compact sets compact?
if so, we can ask for the 'smallest' compact set containing a set


def:
if X is a metric space, f:X->(C or R) is uni cont if:
FA e>0 TE d>0 st. FA x,y, d(x,y)<d => |f(x)-f(y)|<e

thm: if X compact, continuous <=> uniformly continuous
he doesn't prove this

thm: Arzela-Ascoli
Let (X,d) be a compact metric space (C(X),||_∞)
banach sapce of continuous R of C functions
K≤C(X) is compact iff K is closed bounded and equicontinuous


def: equicontinuous if:
FA e>0 TE d>0 st. FA x,y,f d(x,y)<e => |f(x)-f(y)|<e

notice this works for finite sets


proof: if K compact, then its closed and bounded
{Bn(0):n in N} is a cover of the whole space, and thus covers K
thus by compactness, it has a finite subcover
thus K is bounded
say K was not closed, then we have an accumulation point p out side of K
then we cover K by taking sets ever closer to p
however we then take a finite subcover, but it can't get close to p
so we have a contradiction


how to show if its compact, its equicontinuous
let e>0, by compactness, TE f1,f2...fn in C(X) st. U Be(fn) ≥ K
by uniform continuety of each fi, TE d>0 st. FA x,y,i, d(x,y)<d => |fi(x)-fi(y)|<e
....


we visit the converse of the proof on Tuesday
