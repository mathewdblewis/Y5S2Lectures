bounded linear maps (in the book refered to as operators)
consider linear spaces V and W
let L:V->W be a linear map of the linear space V into the space W
(with the same scalar field)
that is, L(au+bv) = aLu+bLv

L:V->W is a linear transformation
L:V->V is a linear operator
L:V->(R/C) is a linear functional

lemma: let L:V->W be a linear transform of NLS, TFAE:
1: L is continuous
2: L is continuous at 0
3: |L| := sup{|Lv|: |v|≤1, v in V}<∞
4: |L| := sup{|Lv|: |v|=1, v in V}<∞
5: TE k≥0 st. FA u,v in V, |Lv-Lu|≤k|v-u|
6: TE k≥0 st. FA v in V, |Lv|≤k|v|

def: if these conditions hold, we say L is bounded

he proves some of these and leaves the rest as an excersize


lemma: B(V,W) = {T:V->W linear transform with |T|<∞}
with || is a normed linear space, and is complete iff W is.

he proves this
