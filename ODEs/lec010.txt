example:
x' = -y - ax√(x^2+y^2)
y' =  x - ay√(x^2+y^2)

for some a in R

notice (0,0) is the only equilibrium
notice the linearization is:
x' = Ax for A = [0  1]
                [-1 0]

notice this is a centre (not contractive in forward or backward time)


rewrite the non linear system in polar coordinates
we get:
ø' = 1
r' = -ar

this clearly is attractive for a>0 and unattractive for a<0
so the linearization doesn't tell us everything

the problem is that the eigenvalues had zero real part



chapter 5: periodic solutions in the plane
poincare bendixson theorem

consider x' = f(x),  x in R^2
f = (f1,f2) and smooth

theorem 6.1: bendixons criteria:
assume D≤R^2 is simply connected (no holes)
and f is C^1 inb D
a nessisary condition for the existance of a
periodic solution is that div(f) = changes
sign in D or equals 0 in D

proof:
recall periodic solutions are closed orbits
let G be the interior of the orbit
recall greens theorem: if we have a vector field (f1,f2) in the plane
then ∫∫_G (f2-f1)dA = ∫_∂G (Pdx+Qdy)

thus ∫∫_G div(f)dA = ∫_C -f2 dx + f1 dy
recall C is an orbit

notice ∫_C -f2 dx + f1 dy = ∫_C (y'x'-x'y') dt = 0
thus ∫_D div(f) = 0 and thus div of f in D is always 0
or it changes sign


he uses this theorem to show the non linear damped
osilator has no periodic solutions
the negative div comes from the fact that you are
damping

example: van der pol oscilator
x"+x = u(1-x^2)x'
equivalently:
x1' = x2                      = f1(x1,x2)
x2' = -x1 + u(1-x1^2)x2       = f2(x1,x2)

div(f) = u(1-x1^2)
thus if a periodic solution exists, it must intersect
one of the lines x1=±1


notice that if a point p1 is on the orbit of p2
then (as sets) p1 and p2 have the same orbit
