classification of critical points (first look at linear systems)
also lets assume the case is non degenerate
so we have y'=Ay for some A with det(A)≠0
notice we can transform the equation in to one of the form y'=By
for some B in jordan form

he tells us to read 3.1

now look at non linear systems:
x' = Ax + g(x) where A non singular and lim x->0 g(x)/|x| = 0
so g has no linear part
in this case the ode has the same characteristics near x=0
as x'=Ax
(eg: positive/negative attractors are preserved)


theorem: if TE eigenvalue l with re(l)>0
the fixed point in not a positive attractor

def: Es = span{ø in C^n: (A-lI)^m ø = 0 with m minimum and re(l)<0} intersect R^n
def: Eu = span{ø in C^n: (A-lI)^m ø = 0 with m minimum and re(l)>0} intersect R^n
def: Ec = span{ø in C^n: (A-lI)^m ø = 0 with m minimum and re(l)=0} intersect R^n

thm: R^n = Es (+) Eu (+) Ec
