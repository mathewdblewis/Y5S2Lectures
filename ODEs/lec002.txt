last time: recap of existance and uniqueness

a first order system of ODEs
(1):  dy/dt = f(t,y),    y(a) = b

a solution to (1) is a C1 function y(t)

also we can integrate (1)
(2):  y(t) = b + ∫f(k,y(k))dk over [a,t]

let T be the transformation (aka map or operator)
defined by y(t) = y -> Ty := Ty(t) = b + ∫f(k,y(k))dk over [a,t]

notice (2) can be rewritten as: y = Ty
thus solutions are just fixed points of the operator T



some notes on fixed points on operators on metric spaces:

def: metric space: (M,p)
where M≠ø, p:M^2->R st:
p(a,b) = p(b,a)
p(a,b) = 0 iff a=b
p(a,c) ≤ p(a,b)+p(b,c)



def: cauchy sequence
a sequence {xn} in M is cauchy if
FA e>0, TE N st. if n,m≥N, then p(xn,xm)<e
recall in R^n, cauchy sequences and
convergent sequences are the same
however they aren't nessisarily in
arbitrary metric spaces

def: (M,p) is complete if all cauchy sequence
has a limit in M

examples: the p norm on R^n for p=2 or other p's

also the sup norm:
p(f,g) = sup|f(t)-g(t)| over a≤t≤b

theorem: the continuous maps from [a,b] to R
with the sup norm makes a complete metric space


example transforms:
1: the map √(1-t^2) on the interval [-1,1]
2: M is the unit circle and T rotates by an angle π/2

he gives more examples

NOTE: if Tx=x we say x is a fixed point of T
also T^0 is the identity and T^n is T composed with itself n times
also T^m(M) = {T^m(x):x in M}

theorem:
if x is a fixed point then x in intersect T^n(M) over n in {1,2,...}
conversely, if intersect T^n(M) = {y} then Ty = y
forward is clear, reverse less so

proof of reverse:
if z in the intersection, then Tz in {z}
thus Tz = z and so the reverse holds
