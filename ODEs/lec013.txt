q1p2 assume orbit is bounded

lemma: if S is a local section of x'=f(x) and y0,y1...yn are distinct points in S
that lie on the same solution curve, then y0,y1,...yn is monotonic along the
solution implies it is monotonic along the section S

proof: it is sufficient to consider 3 points and then extend this to an arbitray
number of points, so we consider y0,y1,y2

let T be the segment in S joining y0 and y1
