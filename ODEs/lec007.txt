recall equilibrium and periodic solution for autonomous equations


notice:
x"+x=0
integrate both sides: x'^2/2+x^2/2=E
this is called the first integral

generalization:
let x:R->R^n be a vector function and F:R^n->R
the derivative of F along x is Lt(F) := ∂F/∂x * x'
= ∑_n ∂F/∂xn * xn'
= d/dt F(x(t))


consider the DE x'=f(x), x in D≤R^n
F is called a 1st integral of the DE
if Lt(F) = 0


def: invariant sets
let M≤D be invariant under the flow x'=f(x) if 
x(0) in M, then x(t) in M so long as the solution exists

we can also define negative and positive invariant
by looking at both directions of time


eg of first integral:
x" + f(x) = 0
d/dt (x'^2/2) + d/dt (∫f(T)dT over [0,x]) = 0

example:
pi' = -∂H/∂qi
qi' = ∂H/∂pi
for some H:R^(2n)->R

H is called the hamiltonian
p and q are called dual variables

Lt H = ∑∂H/∂pi pi' + ∑∂H/∂qi qi' = 0
(see definition and substitute)

NOTE: there is no way in general to know if a first integral exists


louisvilles theorem:
consider x' = f(x), x in R^n
let D(0) ≤R^n have volume v(0) = l(D(0))
where l is the lebesgue measure measure
x' = f(x) defines a flow øt

lemma: dv/dt |_(t=0) = ∫div(f)dx over D(0)

proof: v(t) = ∫1dx over D(t)
= ∫|∂øt/∂z|dz over D(0)        (by change of vars theorem)
eg: x = øt(z) thus dx = |∂øt/∂z| dz

∂øt/∂z = ...

....



cor: the flow generated by a time independent hamiltonian system
is volume preserving
