he states and proves gronwalls inequality
and finds the dependence on ICs theorem as a corollory

he then continuous on to look at autonomous equations

he defines equilibrium as a point where f(x)=0
and periodic solution as a ø st. ø(t) = ø(t+T)
for all t and some specific T>0
(he also asks that T be minimal)

autonomous eqs have 'translation property'
which says if ø is a solution then so is ø(t-t0)
also is



Here is a general trick:
consider x'=y, y'=-x
notice dy/dx = dy/dt / (dx/dt) = -x/y
thus dy/dx = -x/y thus ydy = -xdx
thus y^2+x^2 = C
