if ∂f/∂y exists and bounded near (a,b)
then f is lipshitz near (a,b)
this is sufficient but not nessisary
the proof is done using the MVT

example:
y' = f(t,y) = arctan(t^2+y^2+1), y(0) = 2
∂f/∂y = 2y/(1+(t^2+y^2+1)^2)
thus ∂f/∂y is bounded around any (t0,y0),
in particular, (0,2)
thus by cauchy lipshitz theorem
TE unique solution y defined on t in (-e1,e2)
for e1,e2>0

another excersize: what is the largest interval?


note: higher order ODEs are systems of first order ODEs
then we apply the theorem

|y|y" = 1
y(0)=y'(0) = 0




peano's theorem preliminaries:
let M be a set of continuous f on I = [a,b]
def: M is equicontinuous if FA e>0, TE d
d = d(e) st. FA f in M, FA x,xhat: |x-xhat|<d
implies |f(x)-f(xhat)| < e

notice we need to have the same modolous of continuety
on all functions and all points on the function

example: lipshitz cont functions with lip constant L≤K

Arzela-Ascoli theorem:
every bounded and equicontinuous sequence {fn}≤C(I)
contains a uniformly convergent subsequence with a
limit in C(I)




Peano's theorem:
let f(t,y) be continuous and bounded
in S = I*R with I = [z,z+a] with a>0
then TE at least one y = y(t)
defined on I st. y' = f(t,y)  in I
                 y(z) = q


he proves it
