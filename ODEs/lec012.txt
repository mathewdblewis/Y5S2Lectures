consider planar system x' = f(x)
and assume x0 is not an equilibrium
let V be a unit vector orthogonal to F(x0)
l(x0) is the line through x0 in the direction of V

by continuety of F(x), at x0, TE neigbhourhood v_x0 st.
F(x) cross v ≠ 0
l(x0) is transverse to F(x) around x0, that is, non tangent

let h: R->l(x0) be defined by u->x0+uV   (eg: its a line)



def: an open subinterval of l(x0) containing x0 is a local section @ x0

flow box: given a local secion at x0, contruct a map like so:
(see video)



note: if the box is sufficiently small, the map is bijective

he proves some other stuff, look at the video
he uses the implicit function theorem
