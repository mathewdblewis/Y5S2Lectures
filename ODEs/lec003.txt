Existance and uniqueness of solutions to PDEs

thm 1.3: principle of successive iterations
if T a continuous map on metric space (M,p)
and if lim n->∞ T^n x = y  for some x in M
then Ty = y

recall con't can be defined via convergence
eg: T is cont iff foral xn -> x, Txn -> Tx

now Ty = T lim n->∞ Tn x = lim n->∞ T Tn x (by continuety)
= lim n->∞ Tn x = y


def: contraction map:
let T be a map from the metric space to itself
T is contractive iff TE k, 0≤k<1 st. d(Tx,Ty) ≤ kd(x,y)
FA x,y in M

thm 1.4: contraction mapping thm due to banach 1922
if M is a complete non empty metric space and T:M->M
is a contraction, then T has a unique fixed point

proof: let y in M and consider T^n y
we show these iterates converge
to do this, notice the distance between successive points
always decrease due to the contractive property
we use this repeatedly until we get convergence
because the sequence must be cauchy and the space is
complete thus it converges

he does this proof very carefully


thm 1.5:
consider: y' = f(t,y), y(a) = b
let f(t,y) cont and satisfy lipshitz condition wrt to y
that is, |f(t,y)-f(t,z)| ≤ k|y-z|
this holds in a neighbourhood P1 of (a,b)
then the IVP has a unique sol in a nieghbourhood of a

he proves this
