3.2: linearization near eq points

let x be an eq of x'=f(x)
a is a positive attractor iff
TE neighbourhood (neigh) ø_a if a
with the property if x(t0) in ø_a
then lim t->∞ x(t) = a

a is a negative attractor iff
... (same stuff) lim t->-∞ x(t) = a
Notice its negative for negative attractors


lotka-volterra equations:
x' = ax-bxy
y' = bxy-cy

first find equilibria:
ax=bxy=cy, either x=y=0 or
a/y=b=c/x thus x=c/b,y=a/b
thus we have (0,0) and (c/b,a/b)
then we linearize at each point
here is the derivative:
[a-by, -bx]
[ by, bx-c]
now at (0,0) we get:
[a  0]
[0 -c]
at (c,a)/b we get:
[0 -c]
[a  0]

homoclinic orbits are ones where
you connect two equilibrium points
also could connect an eq point to
itself



lemma 3.2: each closed orbit
corresponds to a periodic solution
in particular, f does not vanish on
the orbit

he proves it
