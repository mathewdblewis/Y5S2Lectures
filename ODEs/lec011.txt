def: p in R^n is called positive limit point of orb(x0) iff
TE tk -> ∞ st. x(tk,x0) -> ∞
the definition for p to be a negative limit point is the
same except tk goes to negative infinity

the w-limit set of orb(x) is the set of all positive limit points of p
the a-limit set .... negative limit points ...

theorem: the limit sets are closed and invariant

FINISH WRITTING DOWN THE THEOREM (see video)

he prove this




def: a set is minimial if it is non empty, closed, invariant
and has no subset which obeys these properties
