B(V,W) = {bdd linear trans of NLS V into NLS W}
|T| = sup{|Tv|: v in V, |v|≤1}

def: V* = B(V,C)    (or B(V,R))
then (V*,||) is a banach space called the dual space of V
the dual space has the norm |T| = sup{|Tv|: v in V, |v|≤1}
and (V**,||) is the double dual


lemma: V,W,Z are NLS
R in B(V,W), S in B(W,Z)
then SR in B(V,Z) and |SR|≤|S||R|

B(V,V) is a banach algebra   (banach space with multiplication st. |SR|≤|S||R|)


hilbert space:
H is a complex vector space in an inner product space
if there is a function <.,.>:HxH->C, st:
<y,x> = conj(<x,y>)
<x+y,z> = <x,z>+<y,z>
<ax,z> = a<x,z>
<x,x>≥0
<x,x>=0 iff x=0
also |x| = √<x,x> defines a norm (or a seminorm if we forgo positive definiteness)


he states the cauchy schwartz inequality and claim it holds
(proof left as excersize)

also we have |x+y|≤|x|+|y|


hilbert space is a complete inner product space
if H0 is a preinner product space (no positive definiteness)
then |x|=√<x,x> is a seminormed and the completion
of (H0,||) is a hilbert space
