chapter 7: dual spaces

def: a sublinear functional (a norm-like function) is a map
p:X->R from a linear space X into the reals st.
p(x+y)≤p(x)+p(y)
p(ax)=ap(x) for a≥0


example of a sublinear functional:
  the norm in a NLS is sublinear
  seminorms are sublinear
  if x* in X* let p(t) = |x*(t)|, then p is sublinear

lemma: han banach lemma
let X be a real vector space and let p:X->R be sublinear
suppose Y≤X is a subspace of X, and f:Y->R is linear
and f is dominated by p, that is, FA y in Y, f(y)≤p(y)
then we have:
  1: if x0 in X-Y, TE c in R st. f'(y+lx0) = f(y)+lc
  defines a linear functional on Y+R*x0 st. f'(y+lx0)≤p(y+lx0)
  2: TE a linear functional  f;:X->R st. f'(y)=f(y) for y in Y
     and f'(x)≤p(x) for x in X


NOTE: we go between using x and x0, these are the same
proof: let Y1 = Y+Rx0, then z = y+lx0 uniquely
suppose c in R and let F(z)=f(y)+lc
F(y1+lx0)=f(y1)+lc and F(y2+lx0) = f(y2)+lc
f(y1)-f(y2) = f(y1-y2) ≤ p(y1-y2) = p(y1+x-x-y2) ≤ p(y1+x)+p(-x-y2)
thus by rearranging we have:
-f(y2)-p(-x-y2) ≤ -f(y1)+p(y1+x)
let A be the sup of the left side and B the inf of the right
let c be in [A,B]

then we have:
-f(y)-p(-y-x) ≤ c ≤ -f(y)+p(y+x)
