banach space: a complete normed linear space

cauchy sequence xn: FA e>0, TE N st. |xn-xm|<e FA m,n≥N

notice completeness is not a topological concept

examples: R,C,R^d, B(X) = {bounded functions (real or complex) on a set X}
|f|_∞ = sup{|f(x)|: x in X}

if X is a topological space, then Cb(X) = {bounded continuous functions on X}
also with the sup norm

If X is a locally compact hausdorff space then we say
C0(X) = {continuous function vanishing at ∞}
again, with sup norm
vanishing at infinity means, FA e>0, TE compact set K st. FA x not in K, f(x)<e

Theorem: if X,Y are compact hausdorff top spaces, then a banach space isomorphism
between C0(X) and C0(Y) gives rise to a homeomorphism between X and Y

theorem: FA banach spaces C, TE a top space X st. C = C0(X)


C^1([0,1]) means functions that have continuous derivatives defined on [0,1]
|f|_C1 = max{|f|_∞,|f'|_∞}
(you could also define it to be the sum)
so now a cauchy sequence must converge in both the function value and derivatives


sequence spaces over N
c_c = finitely supported real or complex sequences over N
c0 = sequences that converge to 0
c = sequences that converge
l^∞ = bounded sequences

if we give these spaces the sup norm, they are all complete except c_c

l1 = sumable sequences with |a|_1 = ∑|an|
lp = ... with norm |x|p = (∑|an|^p)^(1/p)

all the spaces except the first are complete

question: which ones are completions of c_c with an apropriate norm?
question: which spaces contain which?


lemma: absolute convergence
A normed linear space (V,||) is a banach space iff
every absolutely convergent series in V converges

proof: absolute convergent => partial sums are absolute cauchy => are cauchy
via triangle inequality
