he does the missing part of the proof from last time



notice |xn|_∞ = max|xn|, |xn|_2 = √∑|xn|^2, |xn|_1 = ∑|xn|
are not equivalent
however they are equivalent in finite dimension
moreover, |xn|_p is not equivalent to |xn|_q for p≠q





2.1.2: seminorms and quotients
def 2.11: a function p:V->R is a seminorm or pseudonorm if
p(v) ≥ 0, p(av) = |a|p(v), p(v+w) ≤ p(v)+p(w)
notice we now lack definiteness
