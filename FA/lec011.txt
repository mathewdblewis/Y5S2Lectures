thm:
if L_v(x) := <x,v> for x in H is a bounded linear functional on H
then |Lv|=|v|


theorem: all bounded linear functionals are of the form L_v(x) = <x,v>




bounded operations on hilbert spaces
recall T in B(H) = B(H,H)   (bounded linear operators from H to H)
that is, T st. |T|:=sup{|Tx|: |x|≤1}≤∞

theorem: suppose H is a hilbert space
if T in B(H) satisfies FA x in H, <Tx,x> = 0, then T=0

proof: 0 = <T(x+y),x+y>   = <Tx,y> +<Ty,x>
also   0 = <T(x+iy),x+iy> = <Tx,iy>+<Tiy,x> = i<Tx,y>-i<Ty,x>
...
this trick requires complex numbers, so the result fails for real hilbert spaces

cor: if FA x,y in H, <Sx,y> = <Tx,y>, then S=T
proof: consider S-T ....

def: f:H*H->C is a sequilinear form if it is linear on x and conj linear in y
it is bounded iff |f|:=sup{|f(x,y)|=|x|≤1,|y|≤1}<∞


thm: if f is a bdd seqlin form, then TE! operator S in B(H) st.
FA x,y in H,  f(x,y) = <x,Sy>


proof: consider the map x->f(x,y) ...
